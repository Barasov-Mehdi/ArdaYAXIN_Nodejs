        <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: <%= data.lastUpdated %></p>

        <p>This Privacy Policy describes how **<%= data.appName %>** ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and discloses information when you use our mobile application (**"the App"**), which provides on-demand taxi and ride-hailing services.</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

            <li>**Location Information:** We collect **precise and approximate location information from your device** (e.g., GPS, Wi-Fi, cell towers) when the App is running in the foreground or background (if you grant us permission). This is **essential for matching you with nearby drivers, facilitating pick-ups, calculating fares, and tracking your ride.**</li>
            <li>**Ride Information:** Details about your rides, such as pick-up and drop-off locations, routes taken, time and date of travel, fare details, and driver information.</li>
            <li>**Payment Information:** If you make payments through the App, payment details are processed securely by third-party payment processors (e.g., credit card numbers, billing address). We do not store your full payment card details on our servers.</li>

            <li>**Log Data:** IP address, browser type, referring/exit pages, and timestamps.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>

            <li>To **monitor and analyze usage and trends** to understand user behavior and improve the App's functionality and user experience.</li>
            <li>To **ensure the safety and security of our users and services**, including fraud prevention and emergency response.</li>
            <li>To **conduct research and development** to enhance our services.</li>
            <li>To **comply with legal and regulatory obligations.**</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. How We Share Your Information</h2>
        <p>We may share your information with third parties in the following situations:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>**With Drivers:** Your name, pick-up/drop-off locations, contact information (if needed for communication), and ride details are shared with the assigned driver to facilitate your ride.</li>
            <li>**With Other Users:** Limited information may be shared with other users involved in your ride (e.g., if you share your ETA with a friend).</li>
            <li>**With Service Providers:** We may share information with third-party vendors, consultants, and other service providers who perform services on our behalf, such as payment processing, analytics, cloud hosting, mapping services, and customer support.</li>
            <li>**For Legal Reasons:** We may disclose your information if required to do so by law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request, or to protect our rights or the safety of others.</li>
            <li>**Business Transfers:** In connection with any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company.</li>
            <li>**With Your Consent:** We may share your information with your explicit consent or at your direction.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
        <p>We retain your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, provide our services, resolve disputes, establish legal defenses, conduct audits, pursue legitimate business purposes, enforce our agreements, and comply with applicable laws. After this period, we will securely delete or anonymize your information.</p>

        <h2>5. Security of Your Information</h2>
        <p>We implement technical and organizational measures designed to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, alteration, and disclosure.

            <li>Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have the right to access, correct, delete, or restrict the processing of your personal data. Please contact us to exercise these rights.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Our App is not intended for use by children under the age of <%= data.minAge %>. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under <%= data.minAge %>.

        <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. We will notify you of any material changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
